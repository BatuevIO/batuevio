# Hey, I'm Ilya

Iâ€™m a frontend developer with a background in experimental physics. I enjoy building web applications that solve real people problems. My main tools right now:

- Base: Vue 3 (Composition API, SFC, Router, Pinia), TypeScript, Vite, VueUse
- UI: Vuetify, TailwindCss, Storybook, Figma
- Tools: Git, Linux, Webpack, EsLint, Prettier
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
